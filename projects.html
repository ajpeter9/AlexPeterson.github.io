      <hr class="lineLen">
      <p>This was my first project using C# and it was using window forms. It was a focus into using C# and learning the basics. 
        It used bounded list's to store the parts and products. The images above are the home page, the add product page and the add part page. 
        With the product created page, parts could be added to be apart of the product.

      <h2 class="projectname">Scheduling Application</h2>
      <hr class="lineLen">
      <p>This was my second project with C# and it was another Windows From app. It had us focus on more advanced topics within C#, 
        i.e. utilizing lambda expressions. For the project a pre-created MySQL database was created to use to store data. 
        A login screen checked correct login information and had a location identifier, and would change to Spanish if location was in Mexico. 
        Creation of login credentials, new customer, and scheduling an appointment had checks with the database to ensure no duplicates.

      <p>This was my third C# project and it was a .NET Maui application. 
        It was a school scheduling app that allowed the creation of terms, courses, and assessments. 
        The application utilized a SQLite database to store the users data.

      <p>This .NET Maui application was my capstone project for my software Engineering Degree.
